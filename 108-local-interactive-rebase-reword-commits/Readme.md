# Interactive rebase - Re-word commit messages

For a clean history, we have to choose [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). However, sometimes we commit changes with a temporary message or with a typo. We can use [interactive rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_interactive_mode) [`git rebase -i`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#Documentation/git-rebase.txt--i) to _reword_ commits.

## Exercise

In this exercise, we committed changes with some quickly typed commit messages. Reword those messages to follow a good message guideline.
