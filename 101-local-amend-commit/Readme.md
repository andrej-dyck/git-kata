# Amending commits

We just forget something that belongs to the last commit we made. For example, this can be as simple a typo, a not
removed import, or a logical fix.
[`git commit --amend`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---amend) allows us to do that.

## Exercise

In this exercise, we simply forgot to greet Git and remove the unused import. Fix these mistakes and amend the previous
commit.

_Bonus_: Change the commit message to `"Add greeting to Git"`
